# ML_Classification_Vehicles_Data
The goal of this supervised learning project is to predict vehicles class (bus, car, van) based on their numerical attributes.

The project is done using python in Google Colab.

For classification two methods are used separately and then their evaluation scores like accuracy and f1_score are compared with each other.

First Logistic Regression is used, as well as checking if linear relationship exist, and for the second method SVC is used as well as using grid search for finding the best hyperparameters for the algorithm.

The dataset file is provided as a CSV file which can be found in the resourses folder.
